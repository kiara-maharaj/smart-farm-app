Smart Farm Mobile App for university project 2021

COMP301 SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ASSIGNMENT - MOBILE APPLICATION
STUDENT NUMBER: 219008862
NAME: KIARA SHARMA MAHARAJ
APP NAME: "SMARTFARM"
*****************************************
For this project, I have decided to build an app to manage crops on a farm. My parents run a small
business and sell wholesale mealies, tomatoes, lettuce, and other herbs and vegetables. I noticed
that they are unoriganized when it comes to tracking the growth of crops, and managing the farm
based on a weather forecast. So my app allows farmers to view their weather forecast, humidity,
pressure, sunset, sunrise, upload progress pictures of the farm, manage their inventory of
crops, and add tasks that need to be done on the farm. This
app is called "SmartFarm".
